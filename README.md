# Professional ReadMe Generator

## Description
I Created this project knowing it would be a very handy tool for me and many other developers who want quick, precise, and professional ReadMe documentation. Its made with data collected from prompts run by the Inquirer package found in the NPM Library. The data is passed into a ReadMe Template and written by functions created in JavaScript.

Not only did this project give me a better understanding of using the NPM library and running programs in node, but I will never have a unprofessional ReadMe for the rest of my career.

## Installation
To run using Node: git clone repository, use "npm init" to download package.json 

## Usage
Answer prompts to create a well documented README file for your project.
